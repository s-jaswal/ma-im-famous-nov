                            <span class="text-grey">Marathis come from the Maratha Empire in India. This Empire formally
                                began in 1674 with the coronation of Shivaji as Chatrapati (a ruler) and ended in 1818
                                after defeat by the English East India Company.

                            </span><br><br>17th century politics were dominated by several Islamic kingdoms, with the
                            Mughal Empire controlling most of North India.
                            <br>
                            → Chatrapati Shivaji Maharaj awoke a movement against the Mughal Empire. He had two
                            objectives to do this: Respect and Freedom. He started gathering people and revolting
                            against the Mughals and it started to look like they might just attain the independence they
                            dreamed of. However, with his death in 1680, the Mughals started influencing their power and
                            they regained control of places that Shivaji had freed. It looked like Shivaji's dream of
                            independence was going to remain a dream.

                            On April 17, 1720, Shahu nominated Bajirao as Peshwa (Prime Minister), succeeding his

                            jealous of his abilities at such a young age. Bajirao's plan as the new Peshwa was to
                            aggressively expand into North India. 
                            <br><br>
                            He quoted the following: “Let us strike at the trunk

                            and I shall plant the Maratha flag on the walls of Attock”. <br>

                                Jagir in Khargaon preparing to march out with his army, he fell ill and passed away on

                            A famous English historian Sir Richard Carnac Temple wrote, “He died as he lived, in camp

                            fighting Peshwa and the incarnation of Hindu energy.”
                            When Bajirao took over as Peshwa, Maratha territorial limits were confined to tracts in
                            Western India.
